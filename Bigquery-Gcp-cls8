What is mean by Bigquery :
==========================
  BigQuery is a serverless, highly scalable, columnar, SQL-based data warehouse designed for fast analytics on massive datasets without infrastructure management.
 > Modern Data Warehouse :
 -------------------------
   What it means
     BigQuery is not a traditional database (like MySQL, Oracle).
     It is built for analytics, not for transactions.
   Key idea
     Designed to analyze huge volumes of data (GB → TB → PB).
     Optimized for read-heavy analytical queries.
   Interview line
     BigQuery is a fully managed, cloud-native, modern data warehouse for large-scale analytics.

 > Serverless Platform :
 -----------------------
    What it means
      No servers to create
      No clusters to manage
      No patching, scaling, or maintenance
    We only do
      Upload data
      Run SQL queries
    Google handles
      Compute
      Storage
      Scaling
      Availability
    Interview line
      BigQuery is serverless — users don’t manage infrastructure, only data and queries.

 > Highly Scalable :
 -------------------
    What it means
      Automatically scales up and down
      Can handle 1 user or 10,000 users querying at the same time
    Example
      One analyst runs a query on 10 GB
      Another runs a query on 5 PB
    👉 Both work without manual scaling
    Interview line
      BigQuery separates storage and compute, allowing independent and massive scalability

 > To Work With Large Sets of Data :
 -----------------------------------
   What it means
     Built specifically for big data
     Not meant for OLTP workloads (frequent inserts/updates per row)
   Typical data size
     Logs
     Clickstream data
     IoT data
     Financial / analytics data
  Interview contrast 
    Tool	             Purpose
  Cloud SQL	  Small to medium transactional data
  BigQuery	     Large analytical data

 > Tabular / Structured (Schema Defined) : 
 -----------------------------------------
     What it means
       Data is stored in tables
       Each table has:
         Columns
         Data types
         Schema
       Schema types
         Required
         Nullable
         Repeated (arrays)
       Example :
         user_id   STRING
         event_ts  TIMESTAMP
         country   STRING
     Interview note
       BigQuery enforces schema but also supports schema evolution.

 > Built-in Query Engine :
 -------------------------
     What it means
       BigQuery has its own distributed query engine
       Based on Dremel architecture
     Why it’s powerful
       Queries run in parallel across thousands of machines
       No need to install SQL engines
     Interview line
       BigQuery uses a massively parallel processing (MPP) engine.

 > Runs Standard SQL :
 ---------------------
    What it means
      Uses ANSI SQL
      Similar to MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle SQL
    Supports
      JOIN
      GROUP BY
      WINDOW functions
      Subqueries
      CTEs (WITH)
    Example :
    ---------
      SELECT country, COUNT(*) 
      FROM dataset.table
      GROUP BY country;
    Interview tip
      BigQuery supports Standard SQL by default (Legacy SQL is deprecated).

 > Performance :
 ---------------
   a. Terabytes → Seconds
        Queries on TB-scale data often finish in seconds
   b. Petabytes → Minutes
        Even PB-scale queries finish in minutes
   Why
     Columnar storage     : Reads only the required columns instead of the whole row, so queries are faster.
     Distributed execution : Query work is split and run in parallel on many machines at the same time.
     Query pruning        : BigQuery skips unnecessary data blocks/partitions and scans only relevant data.
   Interview line
     BigQuery delivers interactive query performance at massive scale.

 > High Performance Without Managing Infrastructure :
 ----------------------------------------------------
    What it means
      You don’t choose:
        Machine types
        Disk sizes
        Cluster size
      Google auto-optimizes
        CPU
        Memory
        Network
        Storage
      Interview line
        BigQuery abstracts infrastructure complexity while maintaining high performance.

 > No Concept of Indexes :
 -------------------------
    Important concept
      Unlike MySQL / PostgreSQL:
        ❌ No B-Tree indexes
        ❌ No primary key indexes
    Why?
      BigQuery scans data using columnar storage
      Indexes don’t scale well at PB level
    Optimization instead
      Partitioning
      Clustering
    Interview question
      How does BigQuery perform fast queries without indexes?
      Answer: Columnar storage + partitioning + clustering. [ Means Read only needed columns, scan only needed time/data range, and keep related data together for faster queries]

 > Storage Methods :
 -------------------
     a. BigQuery → Columnar Storage
     What it means
       Data stored column-by-column, not row-by-row
     Benefits
       Reads only required columns
       Less data scanned
       Faster queries
       Cheaper
     b. Traditional → Row Storage
       Reads full rows
       Better for transactions, not analytics 
    Interview table
      Storage	      Best for
      Column	      Analytics
       Row	       Transactions

 > Batch + Real-Time Analytics :
 -------------------------------
   Batch
     Load files (CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet)
     Analyze historical data
   Streaming
     Insert data in real time
     Use cases:
       Live dashboards
       Real-time monitoring
   Tools
     Batch: Cloud Storage → BigQuery
     Streaming: Pub/Sub → BigQuery

 > Working (Core Components) :
 -----------------------------
   a. Datasets
      Logical container
      Like a database
   b. Tables
      Actual data storage
      Structured rows & columns
   c. Views
