What is GCS : 
=============
"GCS is a globally scalable object storage service offering multiple storage classes, flexible location options, IAM-based access control, lifecycle management, and strong security integrations. 
 It’s ideal for unstructured data, backups, analytics, and ML workloads."
 Used for static content, backups, analytics, ML

1.0 Core Building Blocks of GCS :
=================================
  1.1 Bucket :
  ------------
  A bucket is the top-level container.
  Important properties:
  Bucket name is globally unique 
  Bucket has a location
  Bucket has a storage class
  Bucket has IAM policies
  Bucket can have lifecycle rules
📌 Interview tip:
  We cannot change bucket location after creation.

  1.2 Object :
  -------------
  An object is the actual data (file)
  Each object has:
    Name
    Data
    Metadata
    Generation number (for versioning)
📌 Objects are immutable → update = upload new version.

 2.0 Bucket Location Options (Very Important 🔥)
 ================================================
   2.1 Region
   -----------
    Example: asia-south1, us-central1
    Use when:
      Low latency needed
      Data residency laws
      Applications running in same region
  📌 Interview example:
       If my users are in India and app is in asia-south1, I’ll choose regional bucket.
   2.2 Dual-Region :
   -----------------
   Example:
     asia1 (Mumbai + Singapore)
     eur4 (Netherlands + Finland)
   Use when:
     High availability
     Disaster recovery
   Read-heavy workloads
  📌 Data automatically replicated across two regions.
  📌 Interview one-liner:
        Dual-region provides higher availability without managing replication manually.
  2.3 Multi-Region :
  ------------------
  Example:
    US
    EU
    ASIA
  Use when:
    Global users
    CDN-style workloads
    Static websites
 📌 Highest availability, slightly higher cost.

 3.0 : Storage Classes (MOST ASKED) : 
 ====================================
   3.1 Standard Storage
   ---------------------
       Hot data
         Used for: 
           Frequently accessed data
           Websites
           Mobile apps
           Streaming
         Characteristics:
           High availability
           No minimum storage duration
      📌 Interview line:
           Standard is best when data is accessed frequently.
   
   3.2 Nearline Storage :
   ---------------------
      Accessed once a month
        Used for:
          Monthly backups
          DR snapshots
        Rules:
          Minimum 30-day storage
          Retrieval cost exists
     📌 Interview comparison:
          Nearline is cheaper than Standard but has access cost.

    3.3 Coldline Storage :
    ----------------------
      Accessed once per quarter
        Used for:
          Compliance backups
          Long-term logs
        Rules:
          Minimum 90-day storage
          Higher access cost

    3.4 : Archive Storage :
    -----------------------
      Very rarely accessed (once a year)
        Used for:
          Legal data
          Audit records
          Long-term retention
        Rules:
          Minimum 365-day storage
          Cheapest storage
          Highest retrieval cost
     📌 Interview trick question:
           Archive is not “slow like tape” — it’s still online, just expensive to read.

  4.0 Access Control Options (IAM vs ACL) :
  =========================================
    4.1 IAM (Recommended ✅)
    -------------------------
       Controls who can do what on bucket or objects
       Roles:
         storage.objectViewer
         storage.objectAdmin
         storage.admin
     📌 Best practice:
           Use IAM, not ACL.

     4.2 Uniform vs Fine-grained Access :
     ------------------------------------
       > Uniform Bucket-Level Access (Recommended)
           Disable ACLs
           IAM only
           Simpler and secure
       > Fine-grained
           Allows ACL + IAM
           Complex
           Legacy setups
      📌 Interview best answer:
            Always use uniform access unless legacy systems require ACLs.

  5.0 Object Versioning :
  =======================
    5.1 What it does :
    -------------------
       Keeps old versions of objects
       Prevents accidental deletes or overwrites
     Use cases:
       Rollback
       Audit
       Safety net
    📌 Important:
          Deleted objects become non-current versions, not removed.

  6.0 Lifecycle Management Rules (Cost Optimization 🔥)
  ======================================================
     Automatically move or delete objects.
     Examples:
       After 30 days → move to Nearline
       After 365 days → Archive
      Delete old versions after 90 days
  📌 Interview scenario:
        Lifecycle rules help reduce storage cost automatically.

  7.0 Retention Policies & Legal Hold (Compliance) :
  ==================================================
   7.1 Retention Policy
   --------------------
      Prevent deletion for X days/years
      Cannot be bypassed
   7.2 Legal Hold :
   ----------------
      Locks individual objects
      Used for investigations
  📌 Interview usage:
        Used in finance, healthcare, compliance workloads.

 8.0 Encryption Options :
 ========================
  8.1 Google-managed keys (Default)
  ---------------------------------
    Automatic
    No management
  8.2 Customer-managed keys (CMEK)
  --------------------------------
    Stored in Cloud KMS
    You control rotation & access
  8.3 Customer-supplied keys (CSEK)
  ---------------------------------
    You provide key per request
    Least used, complex
📌 Interview pick:
      CMEK is best for compliance-driven environments.

 9.0 Data Access Options :
 ========================
  9.1 Signed URLs
  ---------------
    Time-limited access
    No IAM needed
  9.2 Signed Policy Documents
  ---------------------------
    Browser-based uploads
 📌 Interview use case:
       Allow temporary access to private objects.

 10.0 Networking Options :
 =========================
   10.1 Public Access
   ------------------
      Objects accessible via URL
   10.2 Private Access 
   --------------------
      IAM controlled
   10.3 VPC Service Controls 
   -------------------------
     Protect against data exfiltration
  📌 Interview line:
        VPC Service Controls add an extra security boundary.

 11.0 Pricing Factors (Interview Must-Know) :
 ============================================
   Pricing depends on:
  --------------------
     Storage class
     Location
     Data access
     Network egress
     Operations (GET, PUT)
📌 Golden rule:
     Storage is cheap, access is what costs.
