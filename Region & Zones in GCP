What is mean by Region, Zone & Location in GCP : 
================================================
 Location : In GCP, Location tells where a resource lives.
 Region   : A Region is a geographical area like Mumbai or Iowa.
 Zone     : A Zone is an isolated data center inside a region.

A region has multiple zones, and each zone has its own power, cooling, and network.
If one zone fails, other zones in the same region continue working, which helps with high availability.
