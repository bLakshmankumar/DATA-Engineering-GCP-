What is mean by Region, Zone & Location in GCP : 
================================================
In GCP, resources are organized hierarchically.
At the top, we have Location, which defines where a service is available.
Inside a location, we have Regions, which are geographic areas like Mumbai.
Each region contains multiple Zones, and each zone represents a separate data center.
Inside a data center, we run actual resources like virtual machines, disks, and Kubernetes nodes.

How to choose Region & Zone in GCP (Selection Criteria) :
=========================================================
1 > Proximity to users (Latency) :
      Always deploy applications close to target customers to reduce network latency and improve performance.
        Example: Users in India → asia-south1 (Mumbai)
        Benefit: Faster response time, better user experience
2 > High Availability (Multi-Zone deployment) :
      Deploy applications across multiple zones within the same region to protect against unexpected zone failures.
        Use at least 2–3 zones
        If one zone goes down, traffic is served from another zone
        Common for: GKE, VM-based apps, backend services
3 > Disaster Recovery (Multi-Region strategy) :
      For business-critical systems, deploy across multiple regions.
        Protects against regional outages
        Supports active-passive or active-active setups
        Example: asia-south1 + asia-east1
4 > Pricing differences :
      Pricing varies between regions and zones, so cost must be evaluated.
        Compute, storage, and networking costs differ
        Cross-region traffic is more expensive
        Choose region that balances cost and performance
5 > Service availability :
      Not all GCP services are available in every region.
        Some ML, AI, or managed services are region-specific
        Always verify service availability before finalizing region
6 > Data residency & compliance :
      Choose region based on regulatory and compliance requirements.
      Financial or government data may require data to stay in a specific country
        Example: Indian data hosted only in India

Interview-Friendly Summary (Say this confidently) :
====================================================
  I select regions based on user proximity, compliance, pricing, and service availability.
  I deploy applications across multiple zones within a region for high availability, and use multiple regions for disaster recovery when required.
