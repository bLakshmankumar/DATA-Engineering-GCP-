What is Cloud-sql : 
===================
Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service on GCP that provides MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server with automated maintenance, backups, high availability, and secure connectivity.
1. Unstructured Data->GCS :
     What it is: Data that has no predefined format. Think of images, videos, PDFs, or audio files.
     The Path: Because there are no rows or columns to "sort," you just need a giant bucket to hold them.
     The GCP Tool: GCS (Google Cloud Storage). It is an "object store," meaning it’s like a digital warehouse for files of any size.
2. Semi-Structured Data->BigTable
     What it is: Data that doesn't fit perfectly into a rigid table but has some organization (like tags or markers). Common examples are JSON files, XML, or sensor data from IoT devices.
     The Path: This data often moves fast and needs to be accessed quickly for both OLTP (fast updates, like a user profile change) and OLAP (heavy analysis).
     The GCP Tool: BigTable. This is a high-performance "NoSQL" database. It’s designed to handle massive workloads with incredibly low latency (it's what powers Google Search and Maps).
3. Structured Data->OLTP :
     What it is: Highly organized data that fits perfectly into rows and columns, like an Excel sheet or a bank ledger.
     The Path: The diagram specifically points to OLTP (Online Transactional Processing). This is for "day-to-day" operations where accuracy and speed are vital—like swiping a credit card or updating an inventory count.
     The GCP Tool (Contextual): While not named in the bottom box, for structured OLTP, GCP usually uses Cloud SQL or Cloud Spanner.
   Key Terms Defined :
   -------------------
     OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems are designed to run day-to-day operations. They handle a large number of small, fast transactions like inserts and updates, and they must respond in milliseconds with strong data consistency.
     OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems are designed to analyze business data. They handle complex read-heavy queries over large historical datasets, focusing on aggregations and trends rather than real-time updates.
     GCP mapping (very useful) : 
     ---------------------------
         Type   	     GCP-Services
         OLTP   	 Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner
         OLAP	         BigQuery
        Hybrid	   Spanner + BigQuery

# Cloud SQL Setup on GCP — From Scratch :
=========================================
  1. Project prerequisites (very important) :
  -------------------------------------------
      Before creating Cloud SQL, you must have:
      > GCP Project
      -------------
        A project is a logical container
        Billing must be enabled
     👉 If billing is not enabled → Cloud SQL creation will fail
      > Required APIs :
      -----------------
        GCP automatically enables these, but internally it needs:
        Cloud SQL Admin API
        Compute Engine API
        Service Networking API
     👉 Without these → instance won’t create or connect
      > Network decision (think early) :
      ----------------------------------
        Decide:
          Public IP (internet access)
          Private IP (recommended for production)
        This affects security + architecture

   2. Create Cloud SQL Instance :
   ------------------------------
        Navigation :
        ------------
          GCP Console → SQL → Create Instance
        Choose database engine:
          MySQL
          PostgreSQL
          SQL Server
       👉 Interview note: Engine choice depends on application compatibility

   3. Instance Info (Basic) :
   --------------------------
        > Instance ID
        -------------
            Unique name (Cannot be changed later)
               Example [orders-db-prod] : [Used in: Connections, Logs, IAM]
        > Password (root / postgres user) :
        -----------------------------------
            Superuser password
            Required for DB access
        ⚠️ If we lose it → must reset
        > Database version :
        --------------------
            Example:
              MySQL 8.0
              PostgreSQL 15
          👉 Always choose latest stable version
           Better performance
           Security fixes

   4. Region & Zone (Very Important) : [Choose region close to application]
   -----------------------------------
      Region : Where DB physically lives [Ex : asia-south1] 
      Zone options:
         Single Zone
         High Availability (Multi-zone)
      Single Zone
        ✔ Cheaper
        ❌ No automatic failover : No automatic failover means if the database instance goes down, it will not switch to another instance automatically and requires manual intervention to restore service.
      High Availability (Recommended)
        ✔ Automatic failover
        ✔ Zero manual intervention
        ❌ Slightly more cost
     👉 Interview line:
           Production workloads should use HA configuration.

    5. Machine Configuration (CPU & Memory) : 
    ------------------------------------------
         Choose:
           Shared core (small workloads)
           Dedicated core (production)
        If you choose less:
          ❌ Slow queries
          ❌ Connection issues
        If you choose more:
          ❌ Higher cost
        👉 You can scale vertically later, but brief downtime may occur.

   6. Storage Configuration (Critical) :
   -------------------------------------
        > Storage Type : 
        ----------------
          SSD (recommended) : SSD is recommended because it provides much faster read/write performance and lower latency,
          HDD (cheap, slow) : HDD is cheaper but significantly slower, which can impact database performance
       👉 Always choose SSD for production
        > Storage Size : 
        ----------------
           Example : 100 GB, If too small:  ❌ DB stops when disk is full
        > Enable Automatic Storage Increase :
        -------------------------------------
           What it does :
             GCP automatically increases disk when it’s almost full
           If ENABLED:
              ✔ Prevents outages
              ✔ Safer for production
          If NOT enabled:
            ❌ Disk full → DB becomes read-only
            ❌ Manual intervention required

   7. Connectivity Options :
   -------------------------
        > Public IP : [NOT best practice]
        -------------
            Cloud SQL gets a public IP and accepts connections from the internet, restricted by IP allowlist and encrypted using SSL.
            Needs:
              Authorized networks (IP allowlist)
              SSL
              ✔ Easy to connect
              ❌ Less secure
            Why NOT best practice: Exposed to the internet, higher attack surface, relies heavily on firewall rules.
        > Private IP (Recommended) :
        ----------------------------
            DB gets private IP inside VPC [Cloud SQL is assigned a private IP inside your VPC using Private Service Access, and traffic flows entirely over Google’s internal network.]
            Requires Private Service Access
              ✔ Secure    
              ✔ Low latency
             ❌ Slight setup complexity
          Private IP is preferred for internal applications.
          Why best practice: No internet exposure, lower latency, stronger network isolation for internal applications.
        > Cloud SQL Auth Proxy / Connector :
        ------------------------------------
            IAM-based secure connection [The proxy authenticates using IAM, creates a secure tunnel to Cloud SQL, and forwards traffic without exposing DB credentials or IPs. ]
            No DB passwords exposed
               ✔ Best practice
               ✔ Highly secure 
            Why best practice: Eliminates password management, avoids public IPs, works seamlessly with IAM and private networking.

   8. Backup & Recovery Options :
   ------------------------------
       > Automated Backups :
       ---------------------
         Choose:
           Enable
           Backup time window
         If ENABLED:
           ✔ Disaster recovery
           ✔ Point-in-time recovery
         If DISABLED:
           ❌ No recovery if data is lost
        👉 Always enable backups
       > Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) :
       ---------------------------------
         Uses binary logs / WAL logs
         Restore DB to specific timestamp
         ✔ Excellent for accidental deletes 

   9. Maintenance Options :
   ------------------------
       Maintenance Window
         Choose day & time
         GCP applies updates here
       If NOT specified:
         ❌ Updates can happen anytime
         👉 Set maintenance window during low traffic

   10. Advanced Options (Interview Gold ⭐)
   ----------------------------------------
       > Deletion Protection :
       -----------------------
           What it does
             Prevents accidental deletion of instance
           If ENABLED:
             ✔ Cannot delete DB accidentally
           If NOT enabled:
             ❌ One click → DB gone
           👉 Always enable for prod
        > Flags (DB-level tuning) :
        --------------------------
            Examples:
              max_connections
              log_statement
              ✔ Fine-tuning
              ❌ Wrong config can break DB
          > CMEK (Customer-managed encryption key) :
          -------------------------------------------
              Use your own KMS key
                ✔ Compliance
                ❌ Extra complexity
      11. Create Instance :
      --------------------
            Click Create [Takes 5–10 minutes]
            Behind the scenes:
              VM created
              Disk attached
              DB engine installed
              HA replica (if enabled)
