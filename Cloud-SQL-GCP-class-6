What is Cloud-sql : 
===================
Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service on GCP that provides MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server with automated maintenance, backups, high availability, and secure connectivity.
1. Unstructured Data->GCS :
     What it is: Data that has no predefined format. Think of images, videos, PDFs, or audio files.
     The Path: Because there are no rows or columns to "sort," you just need a giant bucket to hold them.
     The GCP Tool: GCS (Google Cloud Storage). It is an "object store," meaning it’s like a digital warehouse for files of any size.
2. Semi-Structured Data->BigTable
     What it is: Data that doesn't fit perfectly into a rigid table but has some organization (like tags or markers). Common examples are JSON files, XML, or sensor data from IoT devices.
     The Path: This data often moves fast and needs to be accessed quickly for both OLTP (fast updates, like a user profile change) and OLAP (heavy analysis).
     The GCP Tool: BigTable. This is a high-performance "NoSQL" database. It’s designed to handle massive workloads with incredibly low latency (it's what powers Google Search and Maps).
3. Structured Data->OLTP :
     What it is: Highly organized data that fits perfectly into rows and columns, like an Excel sheet or a bank ledger.
     The Path: The diagram specifically points to OLTP (Online Transactional Processing). This is for "day-to-day" operations where accuracy and speed are vital—like swiping a credit card or updating an inventory count.
     The GCP Tool (Contextual): While not named in the bottom box, for structured OLTP, GCP usually uses Cloud SQL or Cloud Spanner.
   Key Terms Defined :
   -------------------
     OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems are designed to run day-to-day operations. They handle a large number of small, fast transactions like inserts and updates, and they must respond in milliseconds with strong data consistency.
     OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems are designed to analyze business data. They handle complex read-heavy queries over large historical datasets, focusing on aggregations and trends rather than real-time updates.
     GCP mapping (very useful) : 
     ---------------------------
         Type   	     GCP-Services
         OLTP   	 Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner
         OLAP	         BigQuery
        Hybrid	   Spanner + BigQuery

# Cloud SQL Setup on GCP — From Scratch :
=========================================
  1. Project prerequisites (very important) :
  -------------------------------------------
      Before creating Cloud SQL, you must have:
      > GCP Project
      -------------
        A project is a logical container
        Billing must be enabled
     👉 If billing is not enabled → Cloud SQL creation will fail
      > Required APIs :
      -----------------
        GCP automatically enables these, but internally it needs:
        Cloud SQL Admin API
        Compute Engine API
        Service Networking API
     👉 Without these → instance won’t create or connect
      > Network decision (think early) :
      ----------------------------------
        Decide:
          Public IP (internet access)
          Private IP (recommended for production)
        This affects security + architecture

   2. Create Cloud SQL Instance :
   ------------------------------
        Navigation :
        ------------
          GCP Console → SQL → Create Instance
        Choose database engine:
          MySQL
          PostgreSQL
          SQL Server
       👉 Interview note: Engine choice depends on application compatibility

   3. Instance Info (Basic) :
   --------------------------
        > Instance ID
        -------------
            Unique name (Cannot be changed later)
               Example [orders-db-prod] : [Used in: Connections, Logs, IAM]
        > Password (root / postgres user)
            Superuser password
            Required for DB access
        ⚠️ If we lose it → must reset
