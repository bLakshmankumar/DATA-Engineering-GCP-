Explanation of IAM & Admin in GCP :
=================================
IAM in GCP is used to control access to cloud resources by defining who can perform what actions on which resources.
It works using identities, roles, and permissions applied through IAM policies.
GCP follows a hierarchical resource model where permissions inherit from organization to project to resources.
For security, we follow least privilege, avoid basic roles, use service accounts for workloads, and manage access via groups.

What is IAM in GCP? :
=====================
IAM (Identity and Access Management) in GCP controls
who can do what on which resource.
  In short:
    Who → Identity    :
    What → Permission
    Which resource → GCP resource (project, VM, bucket, etc.)
IAM works using 4 main components:
  Identity → Role → Permissions → Resource
Let’s break them down 👇 :
---------------------------
 1. Identity (WHO) :
      An identity is someone or something that needs access.
      Types of identities:
        Google user → user@gmail.com
        Service account → application or VM identity
        Google group → team-based access
        Domain → entire organization
     👉 Best practice:
           Give access to groups, not individual users.
 2. Permissions (WHAT actions)
      Permissions define exact actions allowed.
      Examples:
        compute.instances.start
        storage.objects.get
        container.pods.list
     ⚠️ We never assign permissions directly — they are grouped into roles.
 3. Roles (Collection of permissions)
      A role is a set of permissions.
      Types of roles in GCP:
        Role Type	Description
        Basic roles	Owner, Editor, Viewer (broad, not recommended)
        Predefined roles	Service-specific, recommended
        Custom roles	Created by you, least privilege
      Example:
        roles/compute.admin
        roles/storage.objectViewer
        roles/container.developer
   👉 Interview Tip:
        Always say “We prefer predefined or custom roles over basic roles.”
 4. Resources (WHERE access applies)
      IAM policies are applied to resources, such as:
        Organization
        Folder
        Project
        Specific resource (VM, bucket, dataset)
      Resource hierarchy:
        Organization
          └── Folder
                └── Project
                      └── Resources (VM, GKE, Storage)
  5. IAM Policy (How access is granted) :
       Role = What actions are allowed
       IAM Policy = Who gets that role, and on which resource
     Important:
       A role does nothing by itself
       It must be attached via an IAM policy 
     Where IAM Policies are applied :
        IAM policies are attached to resources, such as:
          Organization
          Folder
          Project
          Specific resource (bucket, VM, topic)

     ## Can we assign permissions directly to a user?
     ## ANS : No. Permissions are always assigned through roles, and roles are granted via IAM policies.
